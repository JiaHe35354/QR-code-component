## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

This project helped me understand how to center a component using Flexbox and how to position a component to the bottom in the web page.

```css
body {
  font-family: "Outfit", sans-serif;
  background-color: hsl(212, 45%, 89%);
  height: 100vh;

  display: flex;
  justify-content: center;
  align-items: center;

  position: relative;
}

.attribution {
  position: absolute;
  bottom: 1rem;
}
```

### Continued development

In the future, I want to improve my layout and responsive design skills.
